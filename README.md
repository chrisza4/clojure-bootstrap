The goal of this repository is to host templates for all kinds of Clojure applications.

Here are the templates implemented so far:

  /web  
    /rest-crud-demo - Template for a RESTful web api based on code from this [blog post](https://www.codementor.io/@tamizhvendan/developing-restful-apis-in-clojure-using-compojure-api-and-toucan-part-1-oc6yzsigc).
