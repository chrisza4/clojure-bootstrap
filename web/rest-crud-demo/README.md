# rest-crud-demo

FIXME: description

## Installation

### Dependencies

- Install (Clojure)[https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started]
- Install (Leiningen)[https://leiningen.org/] as a package manager.

### Setup database

We simply create a database using this script.

```
> createdb restful-crud

> psql -d restful-crud

restful-crud:> CREATE TABLE "users" (
                id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
                email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
                password_hash TEXT NOT NULL
              );
CREATE TABLE

restful-crud:>
```

It is possible to use a database migration tools such as Flyway. Please update this demo if you feel like it is a better way.
